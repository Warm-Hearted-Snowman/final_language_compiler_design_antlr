**Title: Report on LL(1) Parser and Scanner Analysis**

**Introduction:**
This report provides an analysis of the LL(1) parser and scanner for a given sample code. We will also discuss the steps involved in performing these actions by the compiler and generating intermediate code. The provided sample code demonstrates various control flow structures and variable manipulations. The report aims to explain the process of parsing and scanning the code and generating the corresponding analysis table.

**Sample Code:**
```java
int main(){
    int number1 = -10, number2 = 20;
    loop (number1 & number1 <= number2 & number1++){
        write('This is number1 = int', number1);
    }
    if (number1 < 0) so {
        number1 = -number1;
    }
    until(start <= number2) {
        fact *= start;
        start++;
    }
}
```

**LL(1) Parser Analysis:**
The LL(1) parser analyzes the syntactic structure of the given code and constructs a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST) based on a set of grammar rules. It uses a lookahead of 1 token to make parsing decisions. To perform LL(1) parsing, we need to generate the LL(1) parsing table.

**Scanner Analysis:**
Before parsing, the scanner breaks the input code into individual tokens and categorizes them based on their lexical meaning. The scanner identifies keywords, operators, identifiers, constants, and other tokens present in the code. Let's define the tokens for the given sample code:

- `int`, `main`, `loop`, `if`, `so`, `until`, `write` (Keywords)
- `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `=`, `,`, `<`, `<=` (Delimiters and Operators)
- `number1`, `number2`, `start`, `fact` (Identifiers)
- `-10`, `20` (Integer Constants)
- `'This is number1 = int'` (String Constant)

**LL(1) Parser Analysis Table:**

| Non-terminal | Terminals                | Production Rule               |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| S            | int main { C }           | S -> int main { C }           |
| C            | V C                      | C -> V C                      |
| C            | L C                      | C -> L C                      |

| V            | int V1; V                 | V -> int V1; V                |
| V1           | id = E ;                  | V1 -> id = E ;                |
| L            | loop ( E & E & E ) { C } | L -> loop ( E & E & E ) { C } |
| I            | if ( E ) so { C }         | I -> if ( E ) so { C }        |
| U            | until ( E ) { C }        | U -> until ( E ) { C }        |
| E            | T E'                     | E -> T E'                     |
| E'           | < T E'                   | E' -> < T E'                  |
| E'           | ε                        | E' -> ε                       |
| T            | F T'                     | T -> F T'                     |
| T'           | <= F T'                  | T' -> <= F T'                 |
| T'           | ε                        | T' -> ε                       |
| F            | ( E )                    | F -> ( E )                    |
| F            | id                       | F -> id                       |
| F            | const                    | F -> const                    |
| F            | 'string'                 | F -> 'string'                 |

**Explanation:**
The LL(1) parser analysis table represents the grammar rules for non-terminals and terminals involved in the sample code. Each row corresponds to a non-terminal, and each column represents a terminal or lookahead token. The production rule in each table cell determines the next step of the parsing process based on the non-terminal and lookahead token.

**Intermediate Code Generation:**
After the LL(1) parsing process, the compiler can generate intermediate code, such as three-address code or quadruples, to represent the actions specified by the parsed code. Intermediate code is a lower-level representation that can be further optimized or translated to target machine code.

For the provided sample code, the intermediate code generation would involve analyzing the parsed AST and generating code for variable declarations, control flow structures, expressions, and other statements. Each intermediate code instruction would represent a specific action to be performed by the program.

The specific steps for intermediate code generation depend on the compiler implementation and the target architecture. However, generally, the process involves traversing the AST, identifying nodes that require code generation, and emitting appropriate instructions or sequences of instructions to perform the desired operations.

**Conclusion:**
This report provided an analysis of the LL(1) parser and scanner for the given sample code. The LL(1) parsing table was generated, which helps understand the parsing decisions based on the non-terminals and lookahead tokens. Furthermore, the report briefly discussed the process of generating intermediate code, which represents the actions specified by the parsed code. The intermediate code serves as an intermediate representation that can be further processed or translated into target machine code.
